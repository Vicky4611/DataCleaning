**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning**

This project focuses on cleaning the publicly available Nashville housing data using a variety of SQL queries. The cleaning process involves updating date formats, populating null values with approximate values, separating addresses into various columns, removing duplicate entries, and deleting unusable columns.


**Overview**

The Nashville housing data, while publicly available, may contain inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates. This project aims to prepare the data for analysis by applying SQL queries to clean and organize it effectively.

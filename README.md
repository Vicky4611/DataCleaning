**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning**

This project focuses on cleaning the publicly available Nashville housing data using a variety of SQL queries. The cleaning process involves updating date formats, populating null values with approximate values, separating addresses into various columns, removing duplicate entries, and deleting unusable columns.


**Overview**

The Nashville housing data, while publicly available, may contain inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates. This project aims to prepare the data for analysis by applying SQL queries to clean and organize it effectively.

**Cleaning Steps**

**Date Format Update:** Update the date formats in the dataset to ensure consistency and compatibility with analysis tools.

**Null Value Population:** Populate null values with values that are almost accurate or reasonable approximations based on surrounding data.

**Address Separation:** Split the addresses into various columns such as city and state to enable easier analysis and filtering.

**Duplicate Removal:** Remove duplicate entries from the dataset to ensure accuracy and avoid duplication of information.

**Unusable Column Deletion:** Identify and delete columns that do not contribute to the analysis or contain redundant or irrelevant information.
